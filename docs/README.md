# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for how we run projects, from initiation through deployment and continuous improvement.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, clear ownership, and data-informed decision-making. Our methodology is designed to help cross-functional teams deliver product features, services, and integrations efficiently while maintaining high quality standards.

### Core Principles

Our project management approach is built on five key principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable fast feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

### Project Lifecycle Stages

Every OctoAcme project follows a five-stage lifecycle:

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Determine scope, allocate resources, set milestones, and identify dependencies
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate on deliverables
4. **Release**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, and announce to stakeholders
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings, document outcomes, and identify next steps

### Key Roles

Our project teams typically include:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, manages schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features and collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and ensure acceptance criteria are met
- **Stakeholders**: Provide input, feedback, and approvals throughout the project

## Getting Started

If you're new to OctoAcme's project management processes:

1. Start with the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) to understand our core approach
2. Review the [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) guide to understand team responsibilities
3. Follow the lifecycle guides in sequence ([Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md) → [Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md) → [Execution](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) → [Release](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md) → [Retrospective](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)) as you work through your project

## Using These Docs

- Keep project-specific documentation (like your Project Charter) in your project repository
- Add process-specific docs to `.copilot/` if you want GitHub Copilot Spaces to use them as context
- Refer back to these guides as templates and checklists throughout your project lifecycle
- Adapt these processes to fit your team's needs while maintaining the core principles

## Questions or Feedback?

These processes are living documents. If you have suggestions for improvements or questions about any of these processes, please reach out to your Project Manager or contribute feedback through your team's retrospective process.
