# OctoAcme â€” Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution (with input from all team roles)
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood (Project Manager coordinates with Security Lead, Business Analyst, and other specialists)
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status (Scrum Master tracks team-level risks)

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status
- Customer Support Liaison helps communicate with support teams and customers
- Release Manager coordinates release communications across teams

## Communication Templates
Weekly Status Template:
- Progress this week:

Incident Communication
- Triage summary
- Actions being taken
- Expected timeline
- Post-incident blameless retrospective scheduled

## Escalation Paths
- Team-level -> PM -> Product Lead -> Sponsor
- For security incidents, follow the security incident runbook and notify Security Lead and Security on-call
- For customer-impacting issues, involve Customer Support Liaison early
